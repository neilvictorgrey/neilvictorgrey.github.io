Since the beginning of 2018, I've been tracking my language learning hours with an app called Toggl. What I've discovered is that no matter how hard you try to balance a schedule, time logs don't lie.

The contrast between how I schedule my time now versus when I was in my 20s is stark. Up until around 5 years ago, I would keep everything on a "To Do" list. Now, while I still keep lists of things, I have no expectations that I'm ever going to do them. The only way I know something is going to get done is by putting it on my calendar. So, while a to do list is good for jogging my memory, I don't put any weight into making sure that every item there is checked off. It just doesn't make sense to treat every idea I have with the same weight; so I just write everything down and then when I'm scheduling for the upcoming week, I pull whatever I think is still important into my calendar. It's a fairly simple process, but it's an important one for me.

When scheduling out my time, I start with the things that I have to do. There's a few standing meetings at work that are important for me to be at, so those are the easy things to put in. In most cases they're already there waiting. Second, I schedule out my language lessons for the coming week. Since I need to book my tutors in advance, I've got to get those slots filled in next. Then comes the list; I quickly label my outstanding items with numbers in order to do a quick guage of priority. Then beside each item I take a guess at how much time it's going to take me to complete that thing. All of this takes about 5 minutes, so it's not really a significant burden of time. Once I've got my priority and estimates lined up, I'll start stretching out blocks across my day in Outlook.

Now that I've got everything lined up, I spend about 15 minutes tweaking it and trying to make sure I've got adequate breaktime to allow for context switching. While I'd love to be able to just plug away all day, jumping from the one thing to the next, it can be difficult to do without having everything just blur together into one big mess of a day. So, instead I try to give myself 15 minutes between blocks. Realistically, those breaks may or may not be the exact time that I take off, but I know that from an estimation standpoint it's fairly accurate. If I don't schedule those windows, then I have a lot harder time shimmying things around down the line, when something inevitably takes a bit (or a lot) longer than I'd anticipated.

The following week, the whole process starts over again. If something from the previous week didn't get completed, it goes back on the list with everything else and re-prioritized alongside everything new that came up. There's no point keeping a backlog of items at the top of the list just because you didn't get to them yet. Priorities change and the cost of looking at everything again in the present context is low.

Looking back at my timelogs for the last year, I feel confident about this workflow and that it will continue to be refined as I continue to practice it.
