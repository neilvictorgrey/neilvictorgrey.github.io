There's only so much one can do in a specified period of time. Which means that in order to be effective, we need to make choices about how to spend that time.

I've always been someone who wants to squeeze out every ounce of time and put it to "Good Use". The definitition of what that means has changed over time, but one thing is constant; that I want to feel my time is used purposefully.

In my case, there's a lot of projects that I've wanted to do over the years. Some have successfully launched, while others not so successfully. However, I'm less worried about failing than the things on my bucket list that I've never really put a serious effort into making happen. My list includes playing the violin confidently enough to host a concert or form a band, achieve a master's degree level knowledge in a field of science (Math, Physics, Chemistry), to run an independent design side-business, and to speak 10 languages at at least a level of conversational fluency (CEFR B2) by the time I reach 40 years old. By the end of 2019, I'll have started down the path of each of these, but they're all things that are going to take several years to achieve.

Now, starting a bunch of things at the same time has never been particularly advisable, so I won't be doing that. What I am focused on in the month of March is to optimize my already existing habits of learning German, Spanish, Swedish, and French.

Throughout this month, I'm going to achieve 250+ hours of language study. That means that I need to be putting in 8 hours a day, on average, for the entire month of March. Now we're seeing why the title of this post includes the word madness in it. I've had to get creative with my scheduling, which I'll elaborate on in a further post, but even then I'm going to be pushing it.

A little background on my language learning projects:

My experience learning French goes back all the way to elementary school and continues up through middle-school, where I took 3 years of French immersion, having 6 out of 8 classes each year taken in French. It was a nightmare scenario for me. However, I've sufficiently buried the past and looking forward I want to conquer this beast. I've been working with 3 wonderful tutors on Chatterbug over the last 2 months and I'm just going to stick to what I've been doing on this front.

Learning German, goes back to Oktoberfest 2017, when I stepped off the plane and onto the U-Bahn. The cacophony surrounding me drove me towards wanting to learn the language and be a part of the action. After having now spent time in Switzerland, Austria, and Germany, I feel a sense of belonging. There is so much history to dig in on, the politics are different than here, and the beer's pretty good too. I've almost reached a B2 level here, but need to upgrade my reading, listening, and writing skills. This month I'll be focusing on reading, with a selection of "graded readers" that should help me improve on that front.

Flying from Italy to Spain in March 2018, a fire was ignited to learn the Spanish language. When we arrived in Spain, everyone was just ridiculously friendly! I spent the better portion of 2 months digging in on Spanish, but after we left the country, it was hard to keep up. In January I reset my account with Chatterbug and am attacking it again with vigourous ambition. My plan here is to stay the course and keep doing live lessons 5x a week.

Swedish has been in my backlog since Spain as well. Knowing that we were going to be heading back up to Sweden in June 2018, I wanted to at least have the basics down, so I completed the Pimsleur audio course. While there's still a few of those phrases lingering in the back of my mind, I decided to kick it up a notch and book a lesson on iTalki to get things going more seriously. I'm now 5 lessons in and not looking back. Swedish study is where most of my focus will be going this month, with 8 lessons and over 100 hours independent study planned. I'm looking to know 2500+ words as well as understand roughly how to put them together, all by the end of the month.

That's all the time I have for now folks, so it's off to the races!
